# Introduction to Programming
# Winter semester 2025/26 â€” Assignment1

# Tasks(each has a starter.py and a pytest file):

1) is_strictly_increasing_digits(n)
   - Return True if the digits of a non-negative integer n are strictly increasing from left to right
   - Return False otherwise
   - Return -1 if n is negative or not an intiger

2) sum_of_cubes_even(n)
   - Return the sum of cubes of all even numbers from 0 up to and including n, as a float
   - Return -1 if n is negative or not an integer
   - If n > 2000, print a warning but still compute

3) count_digits_greater_than(n, t)
   - Count how many digits of non-negative integer n are strictly greater than the digit t (0..9)
   - Return -1 if n is negative or if t is not an integer between 0 and 9
